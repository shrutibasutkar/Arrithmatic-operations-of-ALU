# Arrithmatic-operations-of-ALU
This program is performs following arrithmatic operations: Addition(+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication(*), Division(/) and Power($) on hexadecimal operands for ALU.
Five separate function are created for each of above specified operations i.e
* "string Addition(string& Operand1, string& Operand2)"
* "string Mul(string& Operand1, string& Operand2)"
* "string subtraction(string& Operand1, string& Operand2)"
*  void Division(string& Operand1, string& Operand2) 
*  and "string Power(string& Operand1, string& Operand2)"
				
The program receives input file and output file while executing program. This input file contains
few examples to test the arithmatic operations. 
		
The output file will store the result of the examples in the input text file. 
The "fstream" header file is used for input and output filestream.
